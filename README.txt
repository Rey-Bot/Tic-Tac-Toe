# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a python code for a tic toe game.
In this code, we have used functions for creating a board, for placing the marker on the board, for checking if the board is filled or to 
check if there is any space left to place a marker. Here marker is nothing but 'X' and 'O'. To place the marker on a position of your 
choice on the board, i have assigned the position to the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. These numbers would represent in the form of keypad on
keyboard. i.e.

7 | 8 | 9
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
1 | 2 | 3
---------
By using the above format we can place the markers on the board.
